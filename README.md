Kaspa GHOSTDAG Protocol Visualizer

An interactive, dynamic visualization of the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol, designed to provide an intuitive understanding of how a blockDAG operates, how the virtual chain is formed, and how sibling blocks are ordered.

This tool is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, requiring no external libraries.

üö® Important Notice: Current Version Uses Simulated Data

Please be aware that this repository contains the simulation version of the visualizer. The behavior is driven by a client-side JavaScript model designed to demonstrate the core principles of the protocol.

Dummy Data: The block generation, block colors (blue/red), and overall DAG structure are generated by the simulation. They do not represent the live Kaspa network.

Adjusted Protocol Settings: Key parameters, such as the block generation rate (a Poisson distribution averaging 10 BPS) and the frequency of red blocks (intentionally low), have been specifically adjusted for demonstration and educational purposes. This is to ensure a visually engaging and understandable experience, rather than a 1:1 replication of the current network's state.

üöÄ Future Plans: Live Network Integration

The next major milestone for this project is to transition from simulated data to live network data.

This will be achieved by connecting the visualizer to the official Kaspa REST API. This will allow the tool to display the Kaspa mainnet DAG in near real-time, providing an accurate and up-to-the-minute view of the network's health and structure.

‚ú® Key Features

Real-time DAG Simulation: Simulates the continuous generation of blocks and their parent-child relationships.

GHOSTDAG Virtual Chain Calculation: Dynamically identifies and highlights the "virtual chain" (the heaviest chain) based on a chainWork score, mimicking the GHOSTDAG selection algorithm.

Sibling Block Ordering: Implements a sophisticated sorting mechanism where non-virtual-chain blocks (siblings) adjust their horizontal speed to organize themselves according to GHOSTDAG's ordering rules.

Dynamic Zoom & Level of Detail (LOD): Allows users to zoom in to inspect details or zoom out to view the overall structure. The visualizer intelligently adjusts the level of detail, such as hiding block IDs and thinning out DAA scores when zoomed out, to maintain clarity.

Zone-based Logic: The visualization is split into three distinct zones (PARALLEL BLOCKS, GHOSTDAG ORDERING, LINEAR CHAIN), with GHOSTDAG calculations and ordering locked in as blocks transition from right to left.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

üí° Core Concepts Visualized

This visualizer demonstrates two key components of the GHOSTDAG protocol:

Virtual Chain Selection: The main, heavy blue line represents the virtual chain. It is determined by greedily selecting the "heaviest" path backward from the tip of the DAG, where weight is determined by the chainWork (the number of blue blocks in its past).

Sibling Ordering: The blue blocks not on the virtual chain are "siblings." They are ordered based on which block is "more in the past" of the virtual chain. This visualizer simulates this ordering by adjusting the blocks' horizontal velocity, causing them to self-organize into a final, linear order.
